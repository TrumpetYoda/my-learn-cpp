#ifndef ADD_H // header guard. if this macro isnt defined, we define it and include the code for compilations. Otherwise, do not include.
#define ADD_H

// using '#pragma once' is a new way to include header guards autmatically. This is typically a fine solution for most projects.

// This is the content of the .h file, which is where the declarations go
int add(int x, int y); // function prototype for add.h

#endif
